            <p> My diabetes story started in november of the year I turned 6 years old. I had just moved to Canada in july of the year before and making new friends.
                I had an ear infection for months and started wetting the bed. My mom immediately knew something was wrong. The doctor's couldn't find out what was wrong and said I was fine,
                but my mom wasn't convinced. She asked them to check my blood sugar and it was over 33.3 mmol/L! I was rushed to the hosptial and my dad was phone at work.
                I was there for about a week and they taught my parents and I how to carb count and do a lot of mental math to figure out the right ratio of insulin to take.

                At the age of 10, I finally went on the insulin pump which was such a big help because instead of have to poke myself more than 3 times a day for insulin, it was only
                once every 3 days! This was exciting for a while and then i started to get burnt out. High school came with all the changes. Making new friends, adjustiing to a new school, more homework, more responsibility.
                This didn't help my burnout. I probably hit rock bottom
