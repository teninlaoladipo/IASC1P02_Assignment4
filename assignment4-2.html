                My diabetes story started in november of the year I turned 6 years old. I had just moved to Canada in july of the year before and making new friends.
                I had an ear infection for months and started wetting the bed. My mom immediately knew something was wrong. The doctor's couldn't find out what was wrong and said I was fine,
                but my mom wasn't convinced. She asked them to check my blood sugar and it was over 33.3 mmol/L! I was rushed to the hosptial and my dad was phone at work.
                I was there for about a week and they taught my parents and I how to carb count and do a lot of mental math to figure out the right ratio of insulin to take.

                At the age of 10, I finally went on the insulin pump which was such a big help because instead of have to poke myself more than 3 times a day for insulin, it was only
                once every 3 days! This was exciting for a while and then i started to get burnt out. High school came with all the changes. Making new friends, adjusting to a new school, more homework, more responsibility.
                This didn't help my burnout. I probably hit rock bottom in high school and its continued into my undergrad years. Transitioning again into a new environment and living on my own was hard. Having to make another
                set of new friends really sucked. Explaining how type 1 diabetes worked for probably the millionth time was draining. I didn't want to do it anymore. I felt like no one would even understand me and what I've gone through.
                What I didin't realize was how many other people there were with type 1 diabetes. I wasn't alone. It took me a while to find motivation to keep myself healthy, and I'm still trying but I found hope.

              I am still hoping that in the next few years they will find a cure for this autoimmune disease. But for now I can live with scanning my blood sugars using my glucose sensor and pushing buttons on my pump to deliver
              insulin. I'm just glad technology is advancing and more people are being informed. Thank you for reading my story.
